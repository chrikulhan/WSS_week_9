***Student sign in page:
Most of the HTML is written for you

Uses Bootstrap, but Bootstrap is not necessary for Vue
Only to make the page look a little nicer, for example, tables and alerts

Code in the /student directory: student_sign_in.html and styles.css
You'll create the Vue app
Look for the TODO comments in the HTML template
